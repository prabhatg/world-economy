# Architecture decision records

| ADR | Decision | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0001 | Purpose: policy laboratory for human welfare; history is calibration data | Accepted |
| 0002 | Three run modes (free, assimilated reanalysis, scenario forks) on one engine | Accepted |
| 0003 | Start epoch ~12,000 BCE | Accepted |
| 0004 | Adaptive resolution via super-individual agents with split/merge | Accepted |
| 0005 | Multi-dimensional welfare: health, material, capabilities, sustainability | Accepted |
| 0006 | Core in Rust + GPU kernels; Python (PyO3) for orchestration/calibration/AI | Accepted |
| 0007 | Web viewer in TypeScript with deck.gl/CesiumJS; not Flutter/Firebase | Accepted |
| 0008 | Storage: Zarr (fields), Parquet/Arrow (agents, events) on object storage; DuckDB for queries | Proposed |
| 0009 | H3 geodesic hex grid with hierarchical refinement | Proposed |
| 0010 | Bulk-synchronous phased ticks + counter-based RNG for determinism | Proposed |
| 0011 | Cloud-first (spot ensembles), HPC later — amended by 0014 (volunteer tier) | Accepted |
| 0012 | Open source, open provenance | Accepted |
| 0013 | First milestone: Neolithic Southwest Asia vertical slice | Accepted |
| 0014 | Volunteer computing (SETI@home-style) for ensemble workloads; central cluster for coupled runs | Accepted |
| 0015 | Own cloud-native coordinator (Rust, GCP), not BOINC; backend-neutral work units | Accepted |
| 0016 | Bitwise cross-platform determinism is a hard requirement on CPU/WASM | Accepted |
| 0017 | Two-tier numerics: integer/fixed-point conserved quantities, restricted IEEE f64 + own math crate; integer GPU kernels where validated bitwise | Accepted |
| 0018 | Engine compiled to WASM for browser clients; native builds for desktop/mobile/headless | Accepted |
| 0019 | All client types: browser, desktop, mobile, headless | Accepted |
| 0020 | All volunteer types, with separate `science` / `explore` queues | Accepted |
| 0021 | Nonprofit, open-source governance (fiscal sponsor → foundation) | Accepted |
| 0022 | Native client UI shell: Flutter + flutter_rust_bridge | Proposed |

## ADR-0007 rationale (frontend)

Simulation output is terabytes of gridded fields and agent snapshots. Firestore's
document model and per-read pricing are a poor fit; chunked arrays/columnar files on
object storage are the right substrate. The hard UI problem is GPU rendering of
millions of geospatial features on a globe, where deck.gl/CesiumJS/WebGPU are far
ahead of Flutter. Firebase may still be used for auth/hosting if convenient.

## ADR-0017 rationale (numerics)

Integers make conservation of people, goods and money exact over 14,000 simulated years
and make results trivially comparable across hosts. `f64` keeps accuracy for continuous
dynamics; restricting it to IEEE correctly-rounded operations plus our own
transcendental functions makes it bit-reproducible on x86_64, aarch64 and wasm32.
Converting probabilities to integer thresholds makes every stochastic decision exact.
GPU vendors and WGSL do not guarantee correctly rounded division/transcendentals, hence
integer kernels where bitwise validation is needed.

- GPU backend: CUDA (cudarc) vs wgpu vs both.
- H3 vs custom icosahedral grid (H3 cells are not exactly equal-area).
